Virtual Art Collection

I love art and I want everyone to have access to it. 
You don't need to be a millionaire to collect art!
This is an SPA to build a free, virtual art collection of 
the most famous art in the world.

The app has 3 navigation buttons at the top: home, artists, and paintings. 
Additional CRUD functionality is located on each card for the artist 
and on individual cards for the paintings. You can see the artists 
already in the collection. You can view their paintings, as well as 
all the paintings in the collection. You can add an artist to the 
collection, and add paintings to any of the artists. You can like a 
painting, and delete one you don't like!

Goals achieved:
CREATE
-Allow users to add a new artist
-Allow users to add a new painting 

READ 
-Display data of artists
-Display data of paintings 

UPDATE
-Allow users to “like” a painting

DELETE
-Allow users to delete a painting
