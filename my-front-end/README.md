Virtual Art Collection

I love art and I want everyone to have access to it. 
You don't need to be a millionaire to collect art!
This is an SPA to build a free, virtual art collection of the most famous art in the world.

You can see the artists already in the collection. You can view their paintings, as
well as all the paintings in the collection. You can add an artist to the collection, 
and add paintings to any of the artists. You can like a painting, and delete one you don't like!

Goals achieved:

READ 
-Display data of artists
-Display data of paintings 

CREATE
-Allow users to create a new artist
-Allow users to add a new painting to any artist

UPDATE
-Allow users to “like” a painting

DELETE
-Allow users to delete a painting
